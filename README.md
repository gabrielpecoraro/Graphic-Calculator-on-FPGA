# Graphic-Calculator-on-FPGA
A VHDL-based graphing calculator on FPGA that plots mathematical functions on a Pmod OLED display with customizable coefficients.

# VHDL Graphing Calculator

## Project Overview
This project implements a **graphing calculator** using **VHDL** on an **FPGA**. It can plot various mathematical functions, such as exponentials, polynomials, and trigonometric functions, on a **Pmod OLED RGB display**. The system is designed for real-time function visualization and supports customizable coefficients.

## Features
- Supports **exponential, linear, quadratic, and trigonometric functions**
- **Customizable coefficients** using FPGA buttons
- **Optimized implementation** for FPGA efficiency
- **Pmod OLED RGB display support** for graphical output
- Uses **Taylor series and point-by-point plotting**

## Required Software
To work with this project, you will need:
- **Xilinx Vivado** (for synthesis, simulation, and FPGA implementation)
- **VHDL compiler** (included in Vivado)
- **FPGA board** (compatible with Pmod OLED RGB module)
- **Python (optional)** for data analysis and function visualization
